- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amona 
- ðŸ‘€  Hello, Hello there! When I am not coding or diving into data, I am probably resting up. For me, coding is more than a job; it is fun and a way to make life better for everyone. It is where I mix my love for data with creativity and practicality. It is a chance to discover all the amazing things we can do with data, and how we can use it to improve things in a fun and efficient way - a way that makes everyone happy :).
